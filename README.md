# Description:
This project lets the user input a band they like, and provides nearby live music events for similar artists.
#Problem domain:
People are always looking to find new music.  Sometimes committing to going to a live music event is hard because the user may not like the type of music which they bought tickets to.  This app increases the likelyhood of a user finding a new band/event which they will enjoy.
