#Conflict Plan

If a conflict is encountered, group members will call for a vote.  During this voting session members are encouraged to make their opinions known.  Once voting has occurred, all members agree to abide by that vote.
Members who are not adequately contributing, all members have agreed to clearly, yet nicely confront the member in question and tell them where they are falling short of expectations.
If a vote cannot resolve the conflict, we agree to consult a TA or instructor to provide guidance for the tied vote.

#Communication Plan

Our group will communicate primarily through Slack.  Members are expected to be responsive between the hours of 8am - 7pm, unless otherwise noted.

To ensure everyone voices are heard, we will have a pre and post work meeting.  Team members will voice concerns they have and confirm what part of the project they will be working on.  We will also include a mid-day short meeting to ensure everyone is on track with their respective project work, and give them a chance to discuss and problems if needed.

To ensure everyone feels safe - we will treat each other how we would like to be treated.  Constructive criticism is encouraged, and all members are aware that they should take criticism as an opportunity to improve.


#Project Scope

Minimum Viable Product:

Take user artist input and display similar artists.
For each similar artist, display upcoming events.
For each upcoming event, a detail page can be accessed for that specific event.
User selected events will be saved to a SQL database so it can be resubmitted to check current trips that meet their requirements.  This information can be deleted if needed.
Clean, easy to navigate UI/UX.

Stretch goals:

Login/password validation
Calendar
